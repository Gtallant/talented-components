# Talented Components

[![Check Code Quality](https://github.com/Gtallant/talented-components/actions/workflows/codeQuality.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/Gtallant/talented-components/actions/workflows/codeQuality.yml)

An extensible, fully customizeable React component library built in typescript. This is currently a work in progress.

## Motivation

Having worked on a number of large web projects I noticed something - even though the designs look very different, the code is very similar. The goal here is to create a library of react components where the look/feel can be completely changed via JSON configuration.
