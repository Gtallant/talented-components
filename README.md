# Talented Components

An extensible, fully customizeable React component library built in typescript. This is currently a work in progress.

## Motivation

Having worked on a number of large web projects I noticed something - even though the designs look very different, the code is very similar. The goal here is to create a library of rect components where the look/feel can be completely changed via JSON configuration.
